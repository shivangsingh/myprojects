this is my SALESENCORE project using java and mysql with jdbc connection.
this project is basically for car showrooms.
there are two moduels-
administrative module
employee module

employee in show can sign in in their respective accounts and then they can update the 
customers demand like customer name,ph no,address, car intrested in,car color
in there database and they can modify them too.

other part is administrative module by which lost passwords and id's of employees can be 
regained and new account for employee can be created and also can modify customer's information 
and requirement as per administrative rights.
